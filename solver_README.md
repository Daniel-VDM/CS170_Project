# Solver Readme

### Imports
We use a few extra libraries for this project so be sure to have access to numpy and networkx, among others.

### Global Variables
- Here's where we changed path to inputs.
- Here's where we changed path to outputs.
- The code also dumps a JSON file used for solution bookkeeping into our outputs folder as well as a backup.
  Remove both before submitting.

### Sample Execution: 
`python solver.py`
