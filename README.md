# Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (CS170) Course Project.
This was the main programming project done in the course. The goal was to approximate a solution to an NP-Hard problem (detailed in the section below). We had a little over 5 weeks to do this project and we could be in groups of 3. 

During the first 2 weeks, each group had to come up with 3 instances (small, medium and large) of the problem. Then at the end of week 2, all of the group's problem instances were consolidated and distributed.
 
For the remaining 3 weeks, each group wrote a program that would approximate any given instance of the problem. Then, each group ran their program on every group's problem instance and submitted their approximations. Groups were ranked against one another and said ranking was part of the group's grade. Lastly, each group had to do a write up detailing their approximation.
